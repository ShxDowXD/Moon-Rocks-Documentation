## About Mihya

Mihya is an alien that was found abandoned as a very young child by an Astronaut while they were searching for resource-rich planets.

The Astronaut felt bad for her and brought her back to Earth in their ship, in fear of there being hostile entities also present on that moon. When they arrived back on Earth the government were furious that the Astronaut had brought a potentially dangerous alien back and killed them right infront of child Mihya.

Mihya grew up in a secret bunker hidden in the mountains, kept away from society in fear that she could be a danger to the rest of the world. She was assigned a carer who looked after her and taught her Enlgish, which let Mihya communicate with them and tell her story.
