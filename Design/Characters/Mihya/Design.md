# Appearance

Mihya is a pink, blue and purple alien with two sharp fangs and large curly eyebrows.

She wears a dark pink jacket and a blue scarf.

Mihya's face is in the shape of a piechart, allowing her to convey emotions by rotating and changing the proportions and angle of it.

# Inspiration

The design for Mihya was inspired by Temmie Chang's artwork for the album "U.U.F.O" - by the artist "Camellia (かめりあ)"

# Previous Designs

Mihya originally didn't wear a scarf, nor did she have connected arms - I changed the arms so they would be easier to depict, and I added a scarf to connect her head to the rest of her body.
