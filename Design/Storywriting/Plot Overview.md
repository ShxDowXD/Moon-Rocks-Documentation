# Plot Overview

As humanity destroyed itself with wars and mining, the governments realised they needed more resources to stay afloat and keep the earth liveable, but their own home had become scarce of any useful materials.



After many attempts to find a planet with enough resources to sustain the human race, they had come back with little to show for it. In a last ditch effort to save Earth's inhabitants, the governments band together amidst the fighting to send their last exploration rocket to the furthest depths of space possible. Cramming all the fuel left into 4 special engines, you are shot into the cosmos with such force that everyone on Earth feels the shockwave.



This is already your fourth trip into space, yet everything still feels so new to you. Alienated from your friends and family, the realisation that you're essentially a crash dummy for the human race sets in.

Of course they would pick an amateur for this mission, you weren't expected to live - all the governments need is confirmation that there's resources out there, and you would be the lab rat to die proving it to them.



Just as the rocket's fuel gets dangerously low, you hear a deafening boom that leaves your ears ringing, and before you know it the ship is hurtling off course at the speed of light - headed straight for a planet that you can only assume is your final destination.



You close your eyes and hold your breath, waiting for your imminent doom to greet you.
